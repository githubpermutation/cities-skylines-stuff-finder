# FindIt: CTRL-F to find any named citizen, house, car, seagull and... pretty much everything else you named

Press CTRL-F whenever you want to find something you named previously. Works on...

* Citizens
* Houses
* Businesses
* Cars
* Seagulls
* more...?

Hit CTRL-F (search hotkey, hah!), enter the name or a part of the name of what you're looking for (case-insenstive) in the searchbox, hit enter to cycle through all matches. 

* If an exact match is found, it won't look for a part-of-the-name match 
* Use * to cycle through ALL named objects
